# NoSleep

A Simple Minecraft Sponge Plugin to prevent sleeping through the night. To use NoSleep simply install the plugin, no commands, permissions, or configuration required. Once installed, NoSleep will disable the vanilla sleep mechanic of allowing players to sleep through the night in a bed. Players will still be able to enter a bed, however the server will not set the time to day. Perfect for hardcore survival servers where players should suffer the long, perilous night :smiling_imp:

## Support Me
I will **never** charge money for the use of my plugins, however they do require a significant amount of work to maintain and update. If you'd like to show your support and buy me a cup of tea sometime (I don't drink that horrid coffee stuff :P) you can do so [here](https://www.paypal.me/zerthick)
